# RaKTestPorject

In this app a native module has been created

user is able to disable or enable the screenshot in android.
however there is no straight forward method to prevent user to take screenshot. 
that's why you can only test it in android.
After the disable or enable the isAcitvated flag along with other device info is sent to server(mock service).

you can find android release build at : /android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
